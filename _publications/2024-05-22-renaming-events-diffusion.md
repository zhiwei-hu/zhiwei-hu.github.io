Name is an important external identifier that represents the essential characteristics of things. Renaming events within a discipline often reflect the evolutionary characteristics and trends of community identity. Based on discipline-specific catalogs and institutional development history text information, the article comprehensively uses content analysis, quantitative analysis, and evolutionary analysis methods to sort out information on discipline affiliation and name changes within the information resource management discipline community, achieving quantitative tracking and panoramic presentation of the discipline's development process. The article finds that the shaping process of the information resource management discipline identification is divided into different stages. This evolutionary model with intermittent balanced characteristics not only promotes the connotative development of the discipline's content, but also creates conditions for integrating overall discipline identification with local logical thinking.

名称是表征事物本质特点的重要外在标识，学科内部的更名事件往往能够体现共同体认同的演化特征与趋势。文章基于学科专业目录与机构发展历史文本信息，综合运用内容分析、计量分析与演化分析方法，对信息资源管理学科共同体内部的学科隶属与名称变动信息进行梳理，实现学科发展历程的定量跟踪与全景呈现。发现信息资源管理学科认同的塑造过程分为不同阶段，并且这一具有间断均衡特征的演化模式不仅有利于推动学科内涵式发展，也为实现整体学科认同与局部逻辑思维的整合创造了条件。
