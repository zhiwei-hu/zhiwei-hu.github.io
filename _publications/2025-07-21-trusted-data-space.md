In the context of the prominent multiplier effect of data elements and the ongoing strategy of comprehensive urban digital transformation, the planning and deployment experiences of foreign exemplary cases offer practical references for constructing trusted data spaces for smart cities in China. After reviewing the relationship between smart cities and data spaces, the paper conducted a case study on the “Data Space for Smart, Sustainable Cities and Communities” (DS4SSCC) project, led by the European Union (EU), thoroughly examining its development history, project vision and project architecture. Afterwards, the paper summarized the EU’s experience and its implications for China. Future efforts in China should focus on the establishment and integration of four systems, including the synergy of top-level design, technology research and development, ethical governance mechanisms, pilot projects and international dialogues, thereby empowering the high-quality development of smart cities through trusted data spaces.

在数据要素乘数效应凸显、城市全域数字化转型战略深入推进的背景下，提炼国外典型案例的规划与部署经验，有助于为我国面向智慧城市的可信数据空间建设工作提供实践参考。文章首先梳理了智慧城市和数据空间之间的关系，从发展历程、项目愿景、项目架构三个方面对欧盟“面向智慧、可持续城市与社区的数据空间”项目开展了案例分析，最终总结了欧盟的经验及其对我国的启示。未来，我国应注重顶层设计、技术研发、伦理治理机制、试点与国际对话能力提升的合力，以可信数据空间赋能智慧城市高质量发展。
