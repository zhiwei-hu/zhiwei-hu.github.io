[Purpose/significance] To provide reference for measuring and evaluating interdisciplinarity in general emerging interdisciplinary fields，this study is intended to trace the evolution of the digital humanities（DH）field and examine the characteristics of its interdisciplinary ecology by exploring its interdisciplinarity. [Method/process] Taking DH-related journal articles from Scopus as sample，authors’ affiliations were categorized based on a deliberately tailored disciplinary classification system，and a topic model was applied afterward. By integrating both disciplinary and topic diversity，the interdisciplinarity of sampled articles was then measured from the perspectives of scientific collaboration and research content，followed by exploratory classification and multi-dimensional analyses. [Result/conclusion] The DH field is characterized by a continuously growing degree of interdisciplinarity，which could be attributed to its evolution from early explorations among similar disciplines to more robust dialogues among dissimilar ones. A pattern of different roles played by disciplines has been detected，with arts and humanities as the core，computing-related disciplines as supporters，and social sciences as the bridges. The negative impact on collaborative efficiency and sustainability resulting from disciplinary disparity is noteworthy. It is suggested that stakeholders，represented by library and information science，form a synergy in the construction of the DH academic system，and eventually realize the shaping and promotion of the common DH identity through boundary-crossing cooperation.

[目的/意义] 对数字人文研究的跨学科性进行探索性测度，呈现数字人文领域跨学科生态的演化过程和社群特征，为新兴交叉领域的跨学科性测度与评价工作提供参考。 [方法/过程] 以Scopus收录的数字人文相关期刊论文为样本，在设计针对性学科分类体系的基础上开展作者所属机构学科标引和主题探测工作，并融合学科和主题两类多样性，从科学合作和研究内容两个维度进行跨学科性测度、分类与分析。 [结果/结论] 数字人文领域的跨学科性呈现上升趋势，主要体现为从早期相近学科之间的对话转向后期非相近学科之间的交叉融合，形成了以人文学科为核心、技术型学科为辅助、社会科学为连接的学科角色分化格局。以图书情报学为代表的相关学科应充分关注学科话语体系差异对合作效率和可持续性造成的消极影响，形成学术体系建设合力，以跨界合作实现自身身份标识的建构与宣传。
