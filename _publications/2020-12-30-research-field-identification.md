[Purpose/significance] This paper is intended to study topic distribution and term characteristics of domestic LIS teachers' expertise, and to measure its characteristics difference and interdisciplinary degree. [Method/process] After extracting descriptive words from self-reported expertise in the CVs of 1016 teachers from 52 institutions, we identified their domain distributional and interdisciplinary characteristics using methods such as LDA topic clustering, word frequency analysis and membership degree with word categories. [Result/conclusion] It is found that domestic LIS teachers' expertise is centered on the lifecycle of information resource management, and information technology has a high penetration in the current research with a wide range of application scenarios. Specifically, new teachers employed in recent 5 years bear significant characteristics of interdisciplinary and industry-oriented, when referring to the words used in their self-reported expertise. We accordingly put forward some suggestions, including consolidating core knowledge system, promoting information technology to empower contemporary research, and improving interdisciplinary research ability.
