[Purpose/significance] This paper is intended to study topic distribution and term characteristics of domestic LIS teachers' expertise, and to measure its characteristics difference and interdisciplinary degree. [Method/process] After extracting descriptive words from self-reported expertise in the CVs of 1016 teachers from 52 institutions, we identified their domain distributional and interdisciplinary characteristics using methods such as LDA topic clustering, word frequency analysis and membership degree with word categories. [Result/conclusion] It is found that domestic LIS teachers' expertise is centered on the lifecycle of information resource management, and information technology has a high penetration in the current research with a wide range of application scenarios. Specifically, new teachers employed in recent 5 years bear significant characteristics of interdisciplinary and industry-oriented, when referring to the words used in their self-reported expertise. We accordingly put forward some suggestions, including consolidating core knowledge system, promoting information technology to empower contemporary research, and improving interdisciplinary research ability.

[目的/意义]研究国内图书情报与档案管理学科教师群体的专长分布与自述用词特征，测算其特征差异与跨学科程度。 [方法/过程]以中国52所图书情报与档案管理教育机构的1016名教师的个人简历为数据来源，从其自述研究专长中提取描述词，采用LDA主题聚类、词频分析、词类隶属度等方法识别教师专长的领域分布特征与学科交叉特征。 [结果/结论]国内图书情报与档案管理学科教师的研究专长以信息资源管理生命周期为核心；信息技术在当前研究中的渗透力度较高，具有广泛的应用场景；近五年内新入职教师在研究专长用词上呈现出跨学科与行业导向的显著特性。学科的未来发展，需要进一步巩固核心知识体系、推动技术赋能研究、提高跨学科能力。
