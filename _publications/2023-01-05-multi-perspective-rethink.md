[Purpose/Significance] The aim of this paper is to clarify the background of the renaming of the discipline from library, information and archives management to information resources management, analyze the knowledge framework and developing paths of the discipline after its renaming, and provide reference for the future work of discipline construction and educational reform. [Method/Process] Based on survey data including faculty CVs and curriculum, this paper discussed the track of knowledge diversification in information resources management from three different aspects of faculty, curriculum and source of students. The analytical method of the knowledge in information resources management against the new background was then demonstrated, using the existed basic theory and framework. Finally, several paths of discipline construction after its renaming was put forward from the perspective of knowledge integration. [Result/Conclusion] An obvious sign of knowledge diversification is detected in information resources management. Future research, education and practice should be carried out closely around the three-layer knowledge analytical framework of "element-domain-discipline", so as to shape the identity and influence of itself in an open and interdisciplinary environment. Through concrete practice of knowledge integration, it is of great necessity to further carry forward the main theme of adherence and innovation of information resources management, optimize the content and operating mechanism of the curriculum, and promote the talent cultivation reform at multiple levels.

[目的/意义] 明确图书情报与档案管理更名为信息资源管理的背景，探讨学科更名后的知识框架和发展路径，为今后的学科建设与教育改革工作提供参考。[方法/过程] 基于教师履历和课程体系等调研数据，从师资队伍、课程体系和专业生源3个不同方面论述学科知识多元化的现象，基于学科基础理论和框架探讨新环境下信息资源管理学科知识的解析方式，并从知识整合的角度出发阐释学科更名后的专业建设路径。[结果/结论] 信息资源管理学科存在明显的知识多元化现象，未来应紧密围绕“要素–领域–学科” 3层知识解析框架展开研究、教育与实践，在开放的跨学科环境中塑造自身的认同和影响力，以知识整合的具体实践进一步弘扬信息资源管理学科守正拓新的主旋律，优化课程体系的内容与运转机制，并推进多层次的人才培养改革。
