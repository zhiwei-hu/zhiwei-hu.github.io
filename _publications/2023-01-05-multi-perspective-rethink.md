[Purpose/Significance] The aim of this paper is to clarify the background of the renaming of the discipline from library, information and archives management to information resources management, analyze the knowledge framework and developing paths of the discipline after its renaming, and provide reference for the future work of discipline construction and educational reform. [Method/Process] Based on survey data including faculty CVs and curriculum, this paper discussed the track of knowledge diversification in information resources management from three different aspects of faculty, curriculum and source of students. The analytical method of the knowledge in information resources management against the new background was then demonstrated, using the existed basic theory and framework. Finally, several paths of discipline construction after its renaming was put forward from the perspective of knowledge integration. [Result/Conclusion] An obvious sign of knowledge diversification is detected in information resources management. Future research, education and practice should be carried out closely around the three-layer knowledge analytical framework of "element-domain-discipline", so as to shape the identity and influence of itself in an open and interdisciplinary environment. Through concrete practice of knowledge integration, it is of great necessity to further carry forward the main theme of adherence and innovation of information resources management, optimize the content and operating mechanism of the curriculum, and promote the talent cultivation reform at multiple levels.
