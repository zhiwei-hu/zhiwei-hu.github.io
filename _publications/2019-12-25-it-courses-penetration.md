Library and information science (LIS) education faces the challenges to infuse information technology (IT) into its curriculum. This paper collected the curricular data from 139 LIS schools, and took Penetration Index (PI) and Coverage Index (CI) of IT courses to measure the extent of IT penetration. The penetration and coverage of IT courses in LIS education depend on not only the good will of LIS educators but also to a large extent the IT development status in the home country/region of LIS schools.

图书情报教育一直面临着信息技术变革带来的课程变革压力。文章以中国、美国、加拿大、英国、澳大利亚等主要图书情报教育国家的139所相关院系的课程体系设计为对象，采用信息技术渗透率和覆盖率等计量指标，评估了其教育体系的信息技术介入程度。通过横向与纵向的信息技术介入差异比较，探讨了信息技术介入对中国图书情报教育变革的启示。
