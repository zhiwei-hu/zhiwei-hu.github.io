[Purpose/Significance] By quantitatively describing the research landscape of the discipline of library, information and archives management (LIAM), this paper can provide decision support for the establishment of cooperative relationships between institutions, thus promoting the development of interinstitutional cooperation. [Method/Process] By using LDA model and network analysis method, this paper took 67 LIAM schools in China as an example. By thematic clustering of faculty's self-reported research interest texts, the similarity network of institutions was constructed, and community division and potential cooperative relationship mining were performed. [Result/Conclusion] It is found that the current research interests of LIAM faculties in China mainly involve 11 topics, such as information resource management, informetrics and competitive intelligence, and information services and users. The sample schools can be divided into 7 communities, containing 457 pairs of potential cooperative relationships. In the future, in addition to taking part in five approaches of disciplinary integration, LIAM can fully carry out interinstitutional cooperation in scientific research and educational practice in different fields.

[目的/意义] 定量描述图书情报与档案管理学科的研究图景，为各机构之间合作关系的建立提供决策支持，从而推动跨机构合作的发展。[方法/过程] 采用LDA主题模型和网络分析方法，以国内67所图书情报与档案管理教育机构为例，通过对教师自述研究兴趣文本进行主题聚类构建机构相似性网络，并进行社群划分与潜在合作关系挖掘。[结果/结论] 当前国内图书情报与档案管理教师的研究兴趣主要涉及信息资源管理、信息计量与竞争情报、信息服务与用户等11个主题，样本机构可划分为7个社群，包含457对潜在合作关系。未来，图书情报与档案管理学科除了向5种路径进行学科融合之外，还可在不同领域充分展开科研与教育实践的跨机构合作。
