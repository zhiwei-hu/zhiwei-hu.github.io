I am a PhD student in Information Resources Management at the School of Information Management, Nanjing University. Currently, I am also a postgraduate research assistant at the Laboratory of Data Intelligence and Interdisciplinary Innovation, Nanjing University, an affiliated lab to the school. Before pursuing my PhD degree at Nanjing University in 2022, I completed both my MSc (Information Science) and BSc (Information Management and Information System) at the same institution.

My research interests include Scientometrics, Digital Humanities, Library and Information Science Education, and Quantitative Policy Analysis. My PhD project is provisionally centred around the evolution of the Digital Humanities community and its disciplinary identity.

For more detailed information about my works and experience, please refer to other pages on this website. I am always open to discussions and collaborations, so please do not hesitate to reach out to me.
