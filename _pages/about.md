I am Zhiwei Hu (Pronounciation: _Jee-Way Hoo_), a PhD candidate in Information Resources Management at the School of Information Management, Nanjing University (NJU), where I also serve as a postgraduate research assistant at the Laboratory of Data Intelligence and Interdisciplinary Innovation. I earned both my MSc in Information Science and BSc in Information Management and Systems from NJU, focusing on curriculum development, intellectual structures, and interdisciplinarity within Library and Information Science (LIS). From 2025 to 2026, I will join the School of Advanced Study, University of London, as a visiting doctoral researcher, supported by the China Scholarship Council.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Scientometrics, Digital Humanities (DH), LIS Education, and Quantitative Policy Analysis. My current PhD project investigates on collaborative patterns and knowledge integration mechanisms within interdisciplinary research teams, with the DH community serving as a key research context.

I have presented my work at international conferences such as iConference and the Global Forum for Chinese Doctoral Students in Digital Humanities, and my studies have been published in several leading Chinese information science journals. Beyond research, I actively engage in collaborative projects on interdisciplinary education reform, data policy simulation, and smart city data spaces, aiming to bridge academic inquiry with real-world applications.
